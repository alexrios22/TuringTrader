# Creating Custom Indicators

This article needs to be rewritten for the v2 engine. In the meantime, check the [article for v1](../v1/CustomIndicators.md), and the [source code for some simple indicators](https://github.com/fbertram/TuringTrader/blob/develop/TuringTrader.Simulator/Simulator/v2/Indicators/Trend.cs).

Also, check out this [preview of our future implementation](https://github.com/fbertram/TuringTrader/blob/develop/Algorithms/Demo%20Algorithms%20(V2)/Demo09_CustomIndicators.cs).
