# Building DLLs

To develop more sophisticated algorithms, you will need to build a DLL of your code. But, unfortunately, we didn't write this article yet. In the meantime, check out the _BooksAndPubs_ and the _BooksAndPubsV2_ projects, which are included with your binary distribution of TuringTrader. You can also find the code [here (v1)](https://github.com/fbertram/TuringTrader/tree/develop/BooksAndPubs) and [here (v2)](https://github.com/fbertram/TuringTrader/tree/develop/BooksAndPubsV2).
