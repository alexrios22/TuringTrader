# Demo 07: Algorithm Subclassing

Unfortunately, we didn't write this article yet. 

However, the demo code exists in our [repository](https://github.com/fbertram/TuringTrader/blob/master/Algorithms/Demo%20Algorithms/Demo07_Subclassing.cs). The main concept is, that an algorithm can be sub-classed and serve as a data source to another algorithm. This feature is useful to create meta-portfolios, or to use portfolios as a benchmark.
